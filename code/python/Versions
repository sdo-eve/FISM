Added functionality to create versioned tar file from build script
Changed staged file names to those requested by Phil.
mgii data source change:
#      url = "ftp://laspftp.colorado.edu/pub/solstice/sorce_solstice_mg2_index.txt"
      url = "ftp://laspftp.colorado.edu/pub/solstice/composite_mg2.dat"

0.3 11/05/09
Added code to replace value of '.' in with missing data value in 
historical data

0.4 02/11/10
corrected some error handling
removed lengthy debug output
for datasets required endYear values, modified to be relative to current year
added timestamp to output

0.5  02/25/10
Added code to noaa event report fetcher to retrieve 2010 daily files, as
current tar.gz file isn't provided (unlike prior years)
Improved error handling:
  Each fetcher returns success or failure
  Driver stageProxyData decides whether to abort or continue
  (If aborted, Hudson considers job a failure)

0.6  09/29/10
Added output to display end time.
f10.7 path updated from:
  ftp://ftp.ngdc.noaa.gov/STP/SOLAR_DATA/SOLAR_RADIO/FLUX/DAILYPLT.OBS
to:
  ftp://ftp.ngdc.noaa.gov/STP/SOLAR_DATA/SOLAR_RADIO/FLUX/Penticton_Observed/daily/DAILYPLT.OBS

1.2  
Env variable pointing to root of local data location is now intended
to be more generic rather than oriented around FISM needs.  The intent
is that this code will stage data generally.  Individual needs,
such as FISM, will get a subsequent separate copy or link to the 
general store.
Added mains to all DatasetFetchers
Improved path and file naming convention/expectation/handling

SEE data now being fetched to <LOCAL_ROOT>lasp/timed_see/
NOAA event reports now being fetched to <LOCAL_ROOT>noaa/noaa_events/

============================================================
2.0  06/17/11
Code now relies on config file (config.py) as to where to place each dataset.
Now requires LOCAL_DATA_ROOT env var. as root for all destinations.

11.28.11 TODO: change notes go here

2.1  02/03/12
Fetching of SEE data was modified.  Now we mirror these dirs from laspftp/pub/SEE Data as
defined in config.py. These directories already contain the merged files, so those are no 
longer fetched separately.

2.2  03/12/12
All configuration has put into the file config.py.  There dataset sources and destinations 
are specified.  Also, can by used to configure pulling only a subset of datasets.
